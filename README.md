# ev3dev-lang-java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mob41/ev3dev-lang-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mob41/ev3dev-lang-java)

An ev3dev unified language binding for Java, that followed with the [language wrapper specification](http://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.org/en/latest/spec.html).

# Library

This library currently legacy supports ev3dev kernel version 15, but does not support new drivers listed since kernel version 11, and optional drivers in [http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/). 

Still in heavy development, see issue [#15](https://github.com/mob41/ev3dev-lang-java/issues/15) for more details or tracking development stage.
